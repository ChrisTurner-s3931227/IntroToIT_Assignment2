  <h3>Chris Turner - s3931227</h3>

  <p>Chris is 21 years old and has started to study for the Bachelor of IT this year. He comes from an English background with their dad being born in the United Kingdom.
    His hobbies include the usual nerd type stuff such as video games, anime and has enjoyed learning 3D modelling + programming for the past few years on the side.
    They have had a long-term interest in IT since they were 13 years old with their main IT interests being in object orientated programming, computer hardware and reverse engineering of retro software.
    Chris went to study a Certificate IV in Information Technology in 2020, and then a Diploma of Software Development in 2021 – both at a TAFE, which is the only ‘formal’ IT experience they have.

    <br>

    <b>Test Analysis:</b><br>
    The key take aways from this test to keep in mind while working in a group is the introverted aspect.
    Working in a group requires all team members to be active and actively communication with each other,
    solving problems and resolve any conflict that may arise which is the opposite of what an introvert would ‘enjoy’ so to say.
    It’s possible that the agreeableness is a major trait as they wish to avoid that sort of confrontation, which at the same time may make it hard to provide constructive criticism.
    It will be important to get out of this comfort zone of being introverted in order to work efficiently as a group,
    but other team members should also keep in mind this is a foreign/uncomfortable experience for the person as to not too harshly judge them.
    Being overly self-critical may delay how soon the work gets completed also, which other team members will rely on.
  </p>
  <br>

  <h3>Connor O’Loughlin – s3949499</h3>

  <p>
    Connor has recently moved to Melbourne in the last few months in order to study at RMIT for the Bachelor of Information Technology.
    He is an avid fan of video games enjoys watching the occasional TV series.
    Connors interest in IT started quite recently when he took Applied Computing: Software Development in VCE last year where he enjoyed the programming aspect the most.
    The bulk of his current IT knowledge stems from classes he has took in the past where he learnt about different design concepts and a surface level know how of Python.

    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/9EDh5rc.png" alt="bigfive-connor">
    <br>

    <b>Test Analysis:</b><br>
    Two of the major characteristics of this team member to keep in mind is the ambitiousness and at the same time how ‘unfocused’ they may be.
    As this will all be leading to implementing a project idea, it is vital to not come up with an idea that will be overly ambitious for our skill set,
    and also not get ambitious with the features in each stage of development.
    Being unfocused also means that they may forget or lack the motivation to keep up a consistent work ethic in a heavily team-based effort
    (meaning they may need an occasional reminder/push to keep at it). This would also not be a very good pairing with being overly ambitious.
    This member also scored highly on intellect/imagination which is the exact sort of trait you need in a field of problem solving, which will be a valuable asset.

  <h3>Mason Graham – s3953383</h3>
  <p>
    Mason has lived his life in Victoria, coming from a Scottish and Maltese background with their parents moving to Australia in the 1950s as migrants.
    He completed his VCE in 2021 and was able to secure a place at RMIT to study the Bachelor of Information Technology.
    Mason has always had a love for footy and cricket since he was young but has a history of being diagnosed with scoliosis in year 7 and hearing struggles.
    Despite being an outdoors person, he still has had an interest in IT since he was around 14 with a stark interest in the military and governmental applications of computing.
    His prior IT interest comes form studying related fields in VCE, carefully reading the textbooks.

    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/vD0vV0L.png" alt="bigfive-mason">
    <br>

    <b>Test Analysis:</b><br>
    From looking at the test results, it can be concluded that they are a much more independent/individual learner, introverted and empathetic to others around them.
    Having strong independence and individuality means that they will not have to rely heavily on other team members to complete their tasks,
    but at the same time they could be too independent and thus may not communicate clearly enough with their team often enough,
    leaving other members confused or unsure how the overall project is coming along or what they are doing.
    Empathy will be a good characteristic to have as it may mean that they will be easy going if not helpful to members who are struggling,
    helping the team to get along and keep up the pace of the work.
  </p>

  <br>
  <h3>Nate Winter – s3948929</h3>

  <p>
    Nate is a born and raised Australian in a family of 5, with an ancestral history stemming from multiple western European cultures.
    With a diverse family history, Nate enjoys learning different languages, studying Japanese throughout all of high school and is keen to start learning German.
    He has been a fan of videos games since he was only 5 years old, playing them to this very day. His interest in IT started at the same time as his interest in video games,
    finding that he enjoyed tinkering with computers, modifying video games and helping his family with any technical issues that they may have.
    In high school Nate enjoyed taking software development subjects which he could foresee doing as a career,
    and wishes to learn about popular languages like C#, C++ and Swift. He also has a side interest in security and networking, spending time outside of school learning about these things.

    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/XytbEYG.png" alt="bigfive-mason">
    <br>


    <b>Test Analysis:</b><br>
    From these results, Nate can be interpreted as a shy and introverted person, but still very empathetic, understanding and a team player. \
    Like with Mason, this member will be able to understand other members and if they’re struggling, not become frustrated if they are falling behind if not offer to help.
    It also shows that they can be quite self-critical and pessimistic which is both good and bad.
    The good is that it means that their work will that of a high standard and will be able to come up with constructive criticism,
    but may become overwhelmed with critical thoughts and wish to give up which will be important for other team members to keep in mind.
    They may also need help with poor self discipline, needing that occasional push himself.

  </p>

  <h3>Sean Shlemoon – s3660535</h3>

  <p>
    Sean was born and raised in Detroit, Michigan over in the United States with an Assyrian background which is an ethnic/cultural group originating from the Syria/Iraq/Turkey area of the Middle East.
    Sean enjoys programming (testing out different languages and their best applications), learning about the history of different cultures,
    playing video games and creating a potential business plan for the future. Sean’s interest in IT has been there since he was 10 years old,
    being deemed the family “technician” always learning new IT concepts and experimenting (which serves as his prior IT experience).
    His main IT interests revolve around software engineering and cybersecurity due to how much of the current world relies on these areas of specialty.

    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/VZpQ27Y.pngg" alt="bigfive-sean">
    <br>

    <b>Test Analysis:</b><br>
    The most notable result from these tests is the conscientiousness aspect. This means that someone is very diligent, thorough and generally a hard worker.
    There is a very good chance this means that other team members will always be able to rely on them to do a great job.
    Openness was another important aspect which may very much mean that they’ll always be open to what they are thinking about the task at hand
    which is a vital thing to have as working in a team means being open to discussion and criticism. These characteristics would make a great candidate for a team leader,
    and someone you will be able to rely on.

  <h3>Kowsar Rahman - s3825159</h3>

  <p>
    Kowsar is a passionate student originally from Bangladesh who began studying at RMIT in 2019, and is now in his third year of the Bachelor of Computer Science.
    He discovered his love for IT when he was in year 8, taking a keen interest in web development using languages such as PHP hoping to publish a finished app.
    This has evolved to additionally knowing Java, JavaScript and Python.

    </tr>
  </table>

  </p>
  <p>

    <b>Test Analysis:</b><br>
    Kowsar is the most unique out of this team, getting the Architect (INTJ). This implies that he has a more intuitive, thinking/analytical and critical ways of thinking.
    These things could be a massive benefit to the team such as the analytical and intuition aspects, especially when it comes to the implementing the project.
    Creating an IT related project (such as an app) requires an extended amount of careful planning, thinking of how the implementation plan should be structured,
    how they would go about doing it and developing it. These sorts of skills require a very logical way of thinking,
    with the critical and pessimistic aspects helping to keeps things to a feasible/realistic scale, discovering any flaws in the plan to as what wouldn’t really work out,
    and are generally great ways of thinking when it comes to creating an IT related idea (such as with programming).
    Kowsar would be a valuable asset when it comes to development.

  <h2>
    Team Profile - Ideal Jobs
  </h2>


  <h3>Chris Turner – Penetration Tester </h3>
  <p>
    The ideal job for Chris is that of a “penetration tester” or otherwise known as an “ethical hacker”.
    The role of a penetration hacker tester is to perform authorised security tests on computer systems/networks
    in order to find any security vulnerabilities which may lead to sensitive data getting leaked or finances best stolen.
    Chris plans on obtaining these skills by continuing to pick relevant courses in higher education, picking up relevant internships when possible,
    self-study via a combination of textbooks and online courses and attempting to complete previous exams/papers sourced from not only RMIT but other universities
    out there when they feel confident enough.
  </p>


  <h3>Connor O’Loughlin - Systems Analyst/Software Developer</h3>

  <p>
    Connors ideal job is to be a systems analyst. The purpose of a systems analyst is to analyse computers and systems in use of the client,
    determining the best software and hardware to use for the client's needs. This also includes maintenance so everything is up to date,
    working as expected and looking for anything that could be improved upon to improve efficiency of the client. Many system analysts are also programmers,
    creating any specialised piece of software that they may need.
    His plan for achieving a role like this by learning intermediate python skills, improving design and presentation skills,
    and user orientated development via university courses. For the mathematics aspects (statistical modelling)
    he may need to study outside of university for this using whatever resources that can be found on the internet.
    The remainder of the needed skills planned to be picked up naturally as he progresses through university.
  </p>

  <h3>Kowsar Rahman – Full Stack Developer </h3>

  <p>
    Kowsar wishes to become a full stack developer in the future. A full stack dev is simply someone who develops both the back-end side of software
    (the technical side of things the end user doesn’t see, such as the code or the database) and the front end (most often the stuff the user does see, like the UI/UX with HTML and CSS).
    It’s what a lot of people think of when they hear “programmer”.
    Kowsar is already in his final year of university completing many courses and projects both part of university and on the side for fun,
    meaning he already has many of the skills needed for such a role. His skills could be further refined by further developing more complex projects on the side,
    attending “code-a-thon" type events and taking on advanced programming and interview challenges (with websites such as Coderbyte or Leetcode).

  </p>

  <h3>Mason Graham – Systems Administrator/Cyber Security Specialist </h3>

  <p>

    Mason aims to become a systems administrator, hoping to go on to specialise in cyber security related fields.
    A systems admin is the main person responsible for upkeeping and configuring the computer systems and their network.
    This also includes protecting the data stored on the network (hence the cyber security desire).
    Masons wants to get the skills needed by continuing to attend university and picking relevant courses
    over the course of 3 years but also gain experience by taking internships and gaining further understanding (unspecified).
  </p>

  <h3>Nate Winter – Senior Game Development Tools Developer </h3>

  <p>
    Due to Nates passion for video games, he would seek out to become a software developer in the video game industry,
    developing third party tools that game developers over the world use. An example of these tools could be an audio editing piece of software that
    lets audio engineers and programmers build and implement complex audio systems in a variety of game engines (eg: FMOD).
    He has stated that he would prefer to complete a Bachelor of Computer Science as the required skills needed would naturally come through that.
    He would also pick relevant courses and electives in object orientated programming, looking for an opportunity to learn the Unity engine via online documentation and videos,
    and to look for a more entry level game development job upon graduating.
  </p>

  <h3>Sean Shlemoon – Software Engineer</h3>

  <p>
    Seans ideal job would be something akin to a software engineer at a silicon valley type company (such as Google).
    This is developing their websites or applications that are used by millions of people around the world on a daily basis,
    with Google also utilizing and coming up with some of the most innovative technology out there.
    Sean has stated that he plans to gain the skills needed by continuing to study at university,
    self-studying a wide variety of programming languages via online courses or “bootcamps” (at the moment, Java and JavaScript) and hours of hard work.
  </p>


  <h2>Analysis of Ideal Jobs</h2>

  <p>
    After reading over and analysing the all the team members, the following can be concluded:<br><br>
  <ul>
    <li>All the team members ideal jobs involve something to do with software development or programming to some degree.
      The extent of this programming ability differs though. For example: a penetration tester would require intermediate knowledge of scripting languages and
      some traditional languages like Python and mySQL while a software engineer would need years of programming experience of advanced languages such as C++, Java or Python.
      Granted these requirements would depend heavily on the specific job listing</li>

    <br>
    <li>Some or many of these roles would require web development experience also in languages like Java, JavaScript and PHP (and scripting languages like HTML, CSS and mySQL)
      such as for a full stack developer or for someone specializing in a more cyber security orientated role.</li>

    <br>
    <li>Three of these ideal jobs are more software development orientated jobs (Full stack, game developer, software engineer),
      as in these focus much more on creating software for end users to use, while the remaining (penetration tester, systems analyst, systems admin) are more orientated towards creating,
      maintaining and securing systems and networks in use by workplaces and such. </li>

    <br>
    <li>The systems analyst/systems admin/penetration tester are roles that would work well together as they all have some sort of focus on software and network security, making them similar to each other.
      While full-stack/game developer/software engineer would go well together since they all focus on making end software for regular users to use.</li>

    <br>
    <li>As part of our plans to gain the skills required, they all include using university studies as the primary way of obtaining them,
      with the second most common plan to self-study using online resources such as short courses, videos and text-books.
      Taking possible internships was also mentioned a few times</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>

    This knowledge could be applied to how we go on about future tasks, mainly the project itself.
    If we are to develop an app or website, then that task would for the most part be handed off to the members who are interested in heavily software development orientated jobs.
    Meanwhile the more logistical and any security or network side of things could be handed off to the remainder. It is best to hand off tasks that relate to people’s ideal jobs and interests,
    as that would mean they would enjoy doing it thus having more motivation to get a high standard of work done and sooner.
    Overall the group does have a lot in common when it comes to ideal jobs with similar interests and careers.
    They should be able to comfortably understand most potential concepts and terminology that are likely to be brought up.
    The group should be able to get along and work together well.

  <p>
    When it comes to seeing how well the GitHub commit history represents group contributions, this is not a good way of gauging that.
    The reason for this being that all the group work was done in a .docx file in Microsoft Teams,
    where after finishing everything the person who was tasked with the tools section would copy and paste it into the website –
    handling the website by themselves. It was done like this as we believed this would have been the simplest and most streamlined way of doing the website and overall assignment. <br><br>

    Industry Data
  </h2>

  <p>
    Our Team Members Christpher Turner and Mason Graham desires Penetration Tester and Cyber Security Analyst as their preferred job titles. Christopher wants to work as a Penetration Tester which is primarily testing a system’s vulnerability against attacks and best ways to prevent them from hacking. On the other hand, Mason seems himself as the person who will be responsible for taking care of the networking system and helping to protect the data stored on the network. Both Mason and Christopher want to work on the Cyber Security industry. According to Labour Insight Jobs (Burning Glass Technologies) based on Data from March 2018, Active Selections of Professions like Systems Administrator, Network Engineer were 681 and 666, respectively. This is an increasing trend as data back in February 2018 showed 655 and 645 respectively for these two professions based on Active Selections of Last 365 days for both Australia and New Zealand. In Australia, the Cyber Security Industry looks promising ahead as 8 in 10 Australians access the internet daily and use social media accounts. Cybercrime is expected to cost around 1 billion dollars to Australian businesses. Australia already has a reputation as a secure, stable country with a robust regulatory framework and legal protections. There are some interesting data that was captured about the cyber security scenario in Australia. Two-thirds of Australians do not read online privacy policies and almost half do not adjust their privacy settings on social media platforms. Many businesses do not realise they could be an attractive target for cybercrime and underestimate the potential harm it could cause. For many small businesses, the cost of purchasing and maintain digital systems can be an issue. Government of Australia has invested more than $230 million in the Cyber Security Industry. Both Mason and Christopher require appropriate knowledge of how the Network works i.e., different protocols and must remain updated regarding latest attack threats and ways to mitigate them. If there is any programming language that they must be aware of is Python. To enter the industry for both, it is better to hold some certifications in Networking or Ethical Hacking. Aside from using Windows, Mason and Christopher are required to be proficient in using Linux for penetration testing. Soft Skills that are required just like any other job are Communication, Teamwork and Troubleshooting for these two job titles.  
  </p>
  <p>
    Moving on team members like Nate, Connor, Sean, and Kowsar are interested about the software development industry. All 4 of them wants to become a software engineer. Starting with Kowsar. As he wants to become a full stack developer, he needs to have skills in JavaScript, Java, SQL, respectively. Data from Burning Glass based on March 2018, SQL, JavaScript, and Java ranks the top 3 skills based on active selections. On the other hand, Nate is interested to build tools for Game developers. Data of Burning Glass based on March 2018, Graphics Designing has an active selection of 2068 and Microsoft C# has an active selection of 1643. The reason that Microsoft C# has been mentioned because at some point of time, Nate must use Unity Game Development Engine to make elements for games and using Unity requires one an expertise on using C# when it comes to the coding part. In that case data based on February 2018, .NET developer has an active selection of 743 from the Burning Glass Data when it comes to Top IT Job Titles. Connor wants to be a System Analyst or a Software Developer. Titles like Service Desk Analyst, Systems Engineer and Systems Administrator are highly ranked in Burning Glass reports every year. Sean out of all team members has the most ambitious ventures as he sees himself working for a big tech like Google. Sean himself has stated that he would develop skills in JavaScript and Java both which we have seen has great demand when we examined the case of Kowsar. General skills remain the same as we have seen the case of Christopher and Mason.  
  </p>

  <p>
    Overall, the team is divided on two industries: Software Development and Cyber Security. The IT-specific skills that is present in our team members skill set are SQL, JavaScript, Java, Graphic Design, Technical Support, Linux, and they are all ranked in terms of Active Selections based on Burning Glass Data. All of them are highly demanded by Employers and having skill set on multiple of them makes one competitive in the market. Unfortunately, Project Management, SAP and Git being some highly demanded Specialised skills were absent from our skill set. This is because our desired industries have little interaction with the above-mentioned technologies except Git. Git is essential to know when building software in teams. In case of general skills that are in demand but were missed out from our skill set were Mentoring, Quality Assurance and Control and Organisation Skills. Mentoring skill is needed at least for Nate who is due to be working in Senior positions where part of his responsibilities should involve mentoring fellow junior developers. After looking at the Burning Glass Data, opinion about Software Engineer has surely changed. The term Software Engineer is itself a vague title. For example, titles like Front End Developer, .NET Developer, Java Developer, Full Stack Developer has the same responsibilities as Software Engineer. It might be better to focus on a specific skill set or a programming language like Java, Python or JavaScript.

  <h2>
    IT Technologies
  </h2>

  <p>
    The information technology world is constantly changing and evolving with new technological innovations to make our lives more advanced and convenient than ever.
    Because of this it is important for anyone who works in an IT related field to keep up to date and be familiar with these emerging technologies.
    The following are four emerging technologies that have the potential to radically change our lives:
  </p>

  <h3>Technology 1: Clouds, Services and Servers </h3>
  <h3>What does it do?</h3>

  <p>
    Cloud technology (or cloud computing) is the technology where various services are hosted and provided by a third party on their hardware/computers/servers in a data center somewhere in the world.
    In other words, you are renting infrastructure, or in other words “infrastructure as a service”.
    The services that can be provided by cloud computing include things such as file hosting, server hosting, virtual machines (operating systems), and networking.
    Some of the most notable cloud services include Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud.
    This technology has been around for several years now but has progressively become more relied upon and utilized by average day-to-day people,
    to large companies and everyone in-between as the hardware and pricing have improved. (Clapp 2022, p.29)<br><br>

  </p>

  <p>
    Some of the more specific uses of cloud servers include:<br>
  <ul>
    <li>File storing/backups: one of the most popular uses of the cloud is to store and backup any important files in a safe place.
      This means that if you lose your physical medium that these files are stored on, you will be able to redownload them from the cloud service you chose.
      It also gives people the ability to access their data from anywhere in the world as they have access to the internet,
      meaning they will not have to carry around an external hard drive for example. Many people use this for things like family pictures, school material, important documents
      for work or even just their email service. </li>
    <br>
    <li>Virtual machines/computing: a popular use for the cloud in workplace settings is for virtual machines, utilizing more powerful computers.
      The purpose of this ranges from streamlining and cost efficiency of setting up the computers in the workplace (e.g.: all computers are being streamed from a cloud service,
      thus not needing a physical full computer) to performing intensive tasks such as analyzing/processing big data or cryptography.</li>
    <br>
    <li>
      Test environments: extending from virtual machines, cloud provided computers can be used to test a piece of software in a real-world environment without needing to pay for a
      whole new computer with the specific hardware needed. This would cut down development/testing costs enormously.
      The provider would also update the software for you, so there would be no need to remember to update insecure software.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>Business agility: Office environments can still purchase and setup physical hardware (including networking and general IT hardware) themselves which is not only costly but takes time to do.
      With cloud computing delivering everything via servers, office/workplace environments can have their systems up and running in a matter of a few hours.
      There would be no need to get specialists into the workplace to set everything up, which can take an exceptionally long time. </li>
  </ul>
  </p>

    (Vennam, 2020)
  </p>

  <br><br>
  <p>
    As hardware becomes more powerful and the need for large amounts of data storage of physical hardware increases, so will the use of cloud computing services.
    In the future the power of the hardware and storage limits will become more abundant, making lower tier plans even cheaper and thus more appealing for your common person to use.
    By extension, this means the security of cloud services will most likely be improved even further as time goes on as
    having something on a network automatically creates a security target for malicious people.
    Software will also become more modular, meaning pieces or aspects of software will be provided by cloud,
    as this means the end user hardware will not need to be anywhere near as powerful to run the software in mind.
    This could also extend to the improvement to video game steaming services such as Google Stadia or PlayStation Now as now they have limitations with connectivity and accessibility.
    The improvement in cloud services can lead to the improvement of other technologies such as the internet of things (IoT),
    artificial intelligence and analytics/big data as these technologies can already heavily rely on cloud computing due to cost efficiency.
    Although the downside of all of this is increased centralization of data – the reliance of third parties to securely store your data and not be vulnerable to a security breach,
    not use or view your data without consent or have a well-designed data centre so your data will be backed up in case the providers hardware fails (which it will eventually).

  </p>

  <h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>

  <p>
    As similarly discussed in the prior section, the impact of the improvement of cloud technologies means that much more of the world will become drawn towards these cloud services,
    thus relying on them much more. There could be a future where many day-to-day people do not necessarily have a
    regular desktop computer or laptop with the standard hardware you would expect as we do today, but merely a device that is capable of streaming
    a large amount of data to your device from a third-party server. Such a system could easily be embedded to the point where it
    could fit into an average sized computer monitor at a fraction of the cost of the computer they would have otherwise purchased.
    It would also make upgrading your hardware a mostly redundant concept.
    Something like this could heavily impact people who work in consumer level device repair and selling of hardware,
    as this industry would heavily shift towards serving the third-party providers, as the average person would only need the streaming device repaired.
    <br>
    Software development fields would also become a lot streamlined, cheaper and accessible as once again,
    you will not have to rely on purchasing the physical hardware or have the space to store it.
    Intensive software that uses substantial amounts of data or numerous/complex mathematics could be offloaded to the computers of IBM for example
    (such as super or quantum computing, though the price to rent these would end up being expensive, but of course cheaper than if you were to buy the hardware yourself.
    Because of this reduced cost, it would also make computing and the internet much more accessible to people and countries of lower socioeconomic status,
    which would provide numerous benefits such as education, accessing government services, create more efficient and numerous job opportunities or just for entertainment. All of this would lead to improved health and wellbeing for these communities
    and connect the world more than ever.

  </p>


  <h3>How will this effect you?</h3>

  <p>
    Advancements in cloud computing would impact my life in certain ways significantly, for many reasons as described in the prior section “what would be the likely impact”.
    For starters, I would no longer need to worry about maintaining and replacing expensive hardware as parts inevitably die or become obsolete,
    not being powerful enough for my needs anymore. How often I would need to troubleshoot hardware issues would be drastically reduced as that would be all
    handled by people at the provider/data center, meaning less headache and time wasted trying to fix these issues.
    By extension this means storage space would become a negligent concern since cloud storage is already incredibly cheap and will become even cheaper in the future.
    If this becomes the standard way of storing things, then backups would also not be a major concern as by the nature of the storage method, they are automatically backed up (although it would be important to store things on multiple services in
    case your account gets hijacked, shut down or an unrecoverable data loss on the provider’s end for example).
    When it comes to people around me, I believe that it would affect my family positively. For example,
    my mum relies mostly on a phone because it was much cheaper and lower maintenance to use at the cost of a less intuitive UX for websites and apps on a phone.
    Having a computer that is as accessible as a phone would make life tremendously easier, not needing to rely on others for assistance with counter institutive UX when it comes to filling out paperwork or general social media. From experience,
    older generations find getting a computer to be troubling because of the cost and maintenance, so improving this accessibility would help a lot for people not tech savvy. Important files would also be automatically backed up which would lower
    reliance on social media, as many people rely on something like Facebook to archive important photos.
    While all of this sounds very convenient, it comes at the cost of centralization and loss of control.
    We will be placing so many of our files, computing, security, privacy, access and overall trust into the hands of a couple of major cloud providers.
    If we are to go down this path, it will be vital to introduce legislation to reduce security and privacy risk as much as possible.
    We would also be handing over control of our systems to these same companies. At the end of the day, they are the ones who control everything,
    meaning if you use their service in a way they don’t like, they can easily prevent you from doing so.
    While advanced cloud computing would be very convenient for everyone in a range of scenarios, it is still important to ask if it is worth the tradeoffs?

  <h3>Technology 2: Autonomous Vehicles<h3>

    <h3>What does it do?</h3>


  <h3>Technology 3: Machine Learning <h3>

    <h3>What does it do?</h3>
      <p>
        Machine learning focuses on various algorithms that are able to automatically improve by using its experiences.
        These algorithms are split into two categories. Supervised Learning, and Unsupervised learning, these categories each have diverse ways of teaching
        AI (Artificial Intelligence) ways to deal with specific tasks. These algorithms include “Classification” which is used for email spam detection,
        customer retention and medical imaging and “Regressions” which is used to automate weather forecasting, marketing forecasting and population growth predictions.
        Both Classification and Regressions are categorized as Supervised machine learning. On the other hand, there is also algorithms like dimensional reduction
        that focuses on various areas such as facial recognition, data visualisation and structure recovery.
        Clustering is also an algorithm used in machine learning being able to be used for recommender systems,
        targeted marketing, and customer segmentation. The primary difference between supervised and unsupervised learning (Juliabba Delua, 2021)
        is that algorithms under supervised learning are given a “training dataset” by which it first learns from before being deployed to actual datasets.
        This method is more accurate than unsupervised with the trade-off being that more human interaction is required.
        In contrast to this unsupervised learning work purely by themselves to discover the meaning behind datasets.
        Although this method requires less human interaction a data analyst is still required to make sure that the output of the algorithm makes sense.
        This process is still less time consuming than supervised learning however could result in less accurate results.
      </p>


      <h3>What is the current state of the art of machine learning </h3>
        <p>
        One of the main innovations of machine learning is deep learning. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning by which neural networks attempt to simulate the behaviour
        of a human brain via the use of multiple layers of neural networks. (IBM Cloud Education, 2020)
        This is the state of the art of machine learning right now as it allows for additional layers to refine and optimize predictions for a higher level of accuracy.
        Deep learning works by having multi layered, deep neural networks which build upon each other in order to further optimize a prediction or characterisation.
        These algorithms are incredibly complex with ‘multiple layers of interconnected nodes’ where only the input and output layers are the
        ‘visible layers’ whilst the rest of the nodes processing data and classifying it remain hidden. Real world applications of machine learning
        include financial services such as trading stocks, assessing business risks for loan approvals, fraud detection and credit and investment portfolio management.
        </p>

      <h3>What will be able to be done in the next 3 years</h3>

        <p>
          In the next 3 years it is more than likely that machine learning will continue to improve to the point where many jobs and industries will
          be less available to work for due to various processes being automated via machines that have been trained via machine learning. (Predictive Oncology, 2022)
          This can already be seen today as machine learning and artificial intelligence are already being deployed to assist in areas such as cancer research and inventory tracking for businesses.
          This growth is backed up by research performed by Helomics which predicts that the global usage is expected to grow $20 billion by 2025.
           This is because both machine learning and deep learning means that the machines taking over said medical and business industries continuously
           improve and do not need to rest resulting in a possible near 100% uptime and productivity.
        </p>

      <h3>What other technological developments make this possible</h3>
        <p>
          The first neural network was likely one of the most important technologies made to enable the development of machine learning.
          This came into existence with a design made by Frank Rosenblatt in 1957 called the proception model. This algorithm was designed to classify visual inputs into two groups.
          Machine learning’s impact is made clear by a prior development called big data (Kathleen Walch, 2021) because of big data being, as the name implies,
         too large and complex to be analysed by traditional data management technologies could not manage the data efficiently or effectively as they did with regular data.
         This is where machine learning came in and could be used to more efficiently analysed large groups of data that was unable to be analysed via traditional means.
        </p>

      <h3>What is it likely to impact?</h3>
        <p>
          As machine learning develops it is likely that the overall impact it has will be widespread. The smaller impacts include more accurate recommender systems which may result in
          people spending more time watching/listing to content they enjoy on services such as Netflix, YouTube and Spotify and less time looking for something to watch.
          Another small improvement that is likely to happen is improved facial recognition. This can affect areas such as easier face ID and surveillance which may
          cause concerns amongst many people who do not like the idea of over tuned surveillance. On the other hand, significantly larger impacts may be made in the fields of industrial automation,
          this will cause many people in various different fields such as mechanics, health,  administrative work and more will be replaced meaning that these people will lose their work and income,
          this could have much larger societal consequences as it may cause governments to implement a type of universal basic income due to numerous people being shifted outside of their work in favour of more effective, efficient and inexpensive machines/artificial intelligence. Decreased job opportunities and automation may still yield negative results with lower standards of living due to people not being accepted into work. This shift to automation may not be as bad as it sounds however with many products becoming cheaper due to increases in productivity causing a surplus of supplies which will surpass the demand therefore becoming cheaper overall for everyone.
          Meanwhile this shift in automation may further divide the distribution of wealth with the people who own the machines continuing
          to get much richer than everyone else who will likely have a lower chance of gaining a high earning income.
        </p>

      <h3>How will this affect you?</h3>

      <p>
        How will it affect me <br>
        Machine Learning and artificial intelligence will end up being a both passive and active impact on my daily life.
        This may take the form of recommender algorithms making it easier to find content I will enjoy on different streaming service platforms like Netflix, twitch, Spotify,
         and YouTube with it being easier to spend time on each platform without long search times. Another more positive aspect of the impact of machine learning can be the
         improvement and better implementation of smart homes and security with facial recognition, as mentioned earlier being able to differentiate between normal family and
         friends visiting vs an unknown visitor and alerting the owners of the house or even contacting law enforcement to assist in stopping the unknown visitor in the event that they are malicious.
          Regarding smart homes and home automation this can be done through things like Alexa and google which can control aspects of our homes via voice control.
          This may include but is not limited to turning on and off lights, locking the door and turning on and off different devices.
           In a more pessimistic view, it may make it harder for me to find work in a few years' time when industrial automation begins to take off as
           I will be seen as more expensive and less effective than a machine that can do my job faster and more constantly than I could.
           The trade off to this could be that various systems of support and cheaper production of goods may eventually offset this lack of income.
           This may affect my family through similar means to me, with home automation and security being the aspects with my family already owning products like a google home.
           However, in regard to work it is likely to affect them more than it does me due to them running a business that is heavily transport based and thus may be more
           susceptible to losing work due to automation as the existence of auto driving motor vehicles is already available with it only needing time before it goes mainstream.

  <h3>Technology 4: ???<h3>

    <h3>What does it do?</h3>


              <hr>
              <div id="ProjectIdea">
              </div>
              <h2>
                Project Idea
              </h2>


              <h3>Overview</h3>

              <p>Our team have settled on creating a “beach app” for our project, as inspired by Mason Grahams original project idea. This "beach app” will be
              designed with beach goers and travellers in mind, helping people find the best beach that suits what they are looking for.
              We believe an app like this has large user potential as one thing Australia is known for is its beaches - attracting millions of Australians a year,
              with more popular ones such as Bondi Beach attracting plenty of tourists also. With Covid restrictions finally easing, we believe this would be the best time for such an app to emerge.
              The user will be able to search for beaches via distance (or by some other characteristic of their choosing) which will display a list of beaches.
              Selecting a beach will display a variety of information about that beach including things such as location, distance, pollution, water quality, scenery, dog friendly,
              busiest hours, lifeguard available, general user reviews (numerical and written), etc and an overall rating based on all these factors combined.
              The app would gather the information of each of these factors from the users rating/assessment (surveying), which would generate an average rating for each.
              The beaches would be gathered on demand via internet (so not via a locally stored database) therefor requiring an internet connection,
              although the beaches the user have previously searched up will be cached locally.
              </p>

              <h3>Motivation</h3>

              <p>
                Australia has many, many beaches, but how do you know which ones are good and which ones are bad? This is our primary motivation when it comes to the building and
                creating of our beach app. Our goal is to create an app that allows all Australians and Tourists alike to find the perfect beaches to them.
                This takes the form of allowing users to find the beaches most suited to them. With this beach app we aim to give everyone the best experience possible
                which is why we include an option to search for a beach based on the characteristics that they want in their summer experience.
                Do they want a quieter and more comfortable beach, maybe they want a more popular beach in order to meet people.
                We want to empower our users with the choice of what they think will suit them best.
                An additional motivation of our team is to encourage people to get out and start populating beaches again.
                This is in an effort to encourage the growth of Australia's various beaches that may be less popular than they were pre Covid.
                Many people may have no idea what beaches to go to post covid and which ones to avoid,
                this app may assist these kinds of people with up-to-date information that can assist them in finding what beaches are best in this post covid era.
              </p>

              <h3>Description</h3>

              <h3>Tools & Technology</h3>

              <h3>Skills Needed</h3>

              <p>
                In order to build this application, the development team needs skill in Mobile App Development.
                Perhaps this could be better made into an Android App as deploying Android app is cheaper ($25 one-time payment to Google Play).
                Basic UI/UX skill will be required as the app doesn’t seem too complicated. However, as the app is a beach-themed app, proper colour themes would serve a better user experience.
                The beach data would be stored in a database. So the development team needs skill in using database to retrieve information such as opening hours of that beach,
                dog friendly or not, etc. Most importantly, the development team needs to have skills on using third-party APIs to get the exact location and show them the nearest beach.
              </p>

              <h3>Chris Turner</h3>

              <h3>What went well?</h3>
              <p>
                Throughout the entire assignment, everyone was very friendly and cooperative with no arguments or disagreements ever really arising.
                They were fairly easy-going members to work alongside.
                While at the beginning communication wasn’t the greatest due to many members not checking the Microsoft Teams announcements/messages,
                 this would improve drastically after the first week or so with people regularly checking the announcements and communicating.
              </p>

              <h3>What could be improved?</h3>
              <p>
                An issue right up to the end was the amount of work that was being completed. The majority of the group did not end up finishing
                their assigned tasks until the last three days of the assignment actually being due (when a complete draft was meant to be finished a week before the due date).
                This made doing tasks that rely on other parts delayed or harder, such as the finalizing the website some aspects of the project idea.
                But some members may have had valid excuses to as why their parts were delayed (such as needing to defer). It also means that parts of my assigned tasks had to be rushed,
                to have more free time, to account for the scenario where people may not end up doing theirs, thus those tasks falling onto me and/or someone else
                (and explaining any potential bugs on the website side of things). This also forced us to submit a very first draft as there would have been no time at all to refine said first draft.
                In the future it will be very important to get members to start their tasks earlier and with consistent progress, even if it is just 2 or 3 sentences or a few lines of code a day.
