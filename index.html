    <b>Test Analysis:</b><br>
    The key take aways from this test to keep in mind while working in a group is the introverted aspect.
    Working in a group requires all team members to be active and actively communication with each other,
    solving problems and resolve any conflict that may arise which is the opposite of what an introvert would ‘enjoy’ so to say.
    It’s possible that the agreeableness is a major trait as they wish to avoid that sort of confrontation, which at the same time may make it hard to provide constructive criticism.
    It will be important to get out of this comfort zone of being introverted in order to work efficiently as a group,
    but other team members should also keep in mind this is a foreign/uncomfortable experience for the person as to not too harshly judge them.
    Being overly self-critical may delay how soon the work gets completed also, which other team members will rely on.
  </p>

  <h3>Connor O’Loughlin – s3949499</h3>

  <p>
    Connor has recently moved to Melbourne in the last few months in order to study at RMIT for the Bachelor of Information Technology.
    He is an avid fan of video games enjoys watching the occasional TV series.
    Connors interest in IT started quite recently when he took Applied Computing: Software Development in VCE last year where he enjoyed the programming aspect the most.
    The bulk of his current IT knowledge stems from classes he has took in the past where he learnt about different design concepts and a surface level know how of Python.

    <br>

    <b>Test Analysis:</b><br>
    Two of the major characteristics of this team member to keep in mind is the ambitiousness and at the same time how ‘unfocused’ they may be.
    As this will all be leading to implementing a project idea, it is vital to not come up with an idea that will be overly ambitious for our skill set,
    and also not get ambitious with the features in each stage of development.
    Being unfocused also means that they may forget or lack the motivation to keep up a consistent work ethic in a heavily team-based effort
    (meaning they may need an occasional reminder/push to keep at it). This would also not be a very good pairing with being overly ambitious.
    This member also scored highly on intellect/imagination which is the exact sort of trait you need in a field of problem solving, which will be a valuable asset.

  <h3>Mason Graham – s3953383</h3>
  <p>
    Mason has lived his life in Victoria, coming from a Scottish and Maltese background with their parents moving to Australia in the 1950s as migrants.
    He completed his VCE in 2021 and was able to secure a place at RMIT to study the Bachelor of Information Technology.
    Mason has always had a love for footy and cricket since he was young but has a history of being diagnosed with scoliosis in year 7 and hearing struggles.
    Despite being an outdoors person, he still has had an interest in IT since he was around 14 with a stark interest in the military and governmental applications of computing.
    His prior IT interest comes form studying related fields in VCE, carefully reading the textbooks.

  <br>

    <b>Test Analysis:</b><br>
    From looking at the test results, it can be concluded that they are a much more independent/individual learner, introverted and empathetic to others around them.
    Having strong independence and individuality means that they will not have to rely heavily on other team members to complete their tasks,
    but at the same time they could be too independent and thus may not communicate clearly enough with their team often enough,
    leaving other members confused or unsure how the overall project is coming along or what they are doing.
    Empathy will be a good characteristic to have as it may mean that they will be easy going if not helpful to members who are struggling,
    helping the team to get along and keep up the pace of the work.
</p>

  <br>
  <h3>Nate Winter – s3948929</h3>

  <p>
  Nate is a born and raised Australian in a family of 5, with an ancestral history stemming from multiple western European cultures.
  With a diverse family history, Nate enjoys learning different languages, studying Japanese throughout all of high school and is keen to start learning German.
  He has been a fan of videos games since he was only 5 years old, playing them to this very day. His interest in IT started at the same time as his interest in video games,
  finding that he enjoyed tinkering with computers, modifying video games and helping his family with any technical issues that they may have.
  In high school Nate enjoyed taking software development subjects which he could foresee doing as a career,
  and wishes to learn about popular languages like C#, C++ and Swift. He also has a side interest in security and networking, spending time outside of school learning about these things.

  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/XytbEYG.png" alt="bigfive-mason">
  <br>


    <b>Test Analysis:</b><br>
    From these results, Nate can be interpreted as a shy and introverted person, but still very empathetic, understanding and a team player. \
    Like with Mason, this member will be able to understand other members and if they’re struggling, not become frustrated if they are falling behind if not offer to help.
    It also shows that they can be quite self-critical and pessimistic which is both good and bad.
    The good is that it means that their work will that of a high standard and will be able to come up with constructive criticism,
    but may become overwhelmed with critical thoughts and wish to give up which will be important for other team members to keep in mind.
    They may also need help with poor self discipline, needing that occasional push himself.

  <h3>Sean Shlemoon – s3660535</h3>

  <p>
  Sean was born and raised in Detroit, Michigan over in the United States with an Assyrian background which is an ethnic/cultural group originating from the Syria/Iraq/Turkey area of the Middle East.
  Sean enjoys programming (testing out different languages and their best applications), learning about the history of different cultures,
  playing video games and creating a potential business plan for the future. Sean’s interest in IT has been there since he was 10 years old,
  being deemed the family “technician” always learning new IT concepts and experimenting (which serves as his prior IT experience).
  His main IT interests revolve around software engineering and cybersecurity due to how much of the current world relies on these areas of specialty.

  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/VZpQ27Y.pngg" alt="bigfive-sean">
  <br>

    <b>Test Analysis:</b><br>
    The most notable result from these tests is the conscientiousness aspect. This means that someone is very diligent, thorough and generally a hard worker.
    There is a very good chance this means that other team members will always be able to rely on them to do a great job.
    Openness was another important aspect which may very much mean that they’ll always be open to what they are thinking about the task at hand
    which is a vital thing to have as working in a team means being open to discussion and criticism. These characteristics would make a great candidate for a team leader,
    and someone you will be able to rely on.

  <h3>Kowsar Rahman - s3825159</h3>

  <p>
    Kowsar is a passionate student originally from Bangladesh who began studying at RMIT in 2019, and is now in his third year of the Bachelor of Computer Science.
    He discovered his love for IT when he was in year 8, taking a keen interest in web development using languages such as PHP hoping to publish a finished app.
    This has evolved to additionally knowing Java, JavaScript and Python.

</p>
<p>

    <b>Test Analysis:</b><br>
    Kowsar is the most unique out of this team, getting the Architect (INTJ). This implies that he has a more intuitive, thinking/analytical and critical ways of thinking.
    These things could be a massive benefit to the team such as the analytical and intuition aspects, especially when it comes to the implementing the project.
    Creating an IT related project (such as an app) requires an extended amount of careful planning, thinking of how the implementation plan should be structured,
    how they would go about doing it and developing it. These sorts of skills require a very logical way of thinking,
    with the critical and pessimistic aspects helping to keeps things to a feasible/realistic scale, discovering any flaws in the plan to as what wouldn’t really work out,
    and are generally great ways of thinking when it comes to creating an IT related idea (such as with programming).
    Kowsar would be a valuable asset when it comes to development.

  <h2>
    Team Profile - Ideal Jobs
  </h2>


  <h3>Chris Turner – Penetration Tester </h3>
  <p>
    The ideal job for Chris is that of a “penetration tester” or otherwise known as an “ethical hacker”.
    The role of a penetration hacker tester is to perform authorised security tests on computer systems/networks
    in order to find any security vulnerabilities which may lead to sensitive data getting leaked or finances best stolen.
    Chris plans on obtaining these skills by continuing to pick relevant courses in higher education, picking up relevant internships when possible,
    self-study via a combination of textbooks and online courses and attempting to complete previous exams/papers sourced from not only RMIT but other universities
    out there when they feel confident enough.
  </p>


  <h3>Connor O’Loughlin - Systems Analyst/Software Developer</h3>

  <p>
    Connors ideal job is to be a systems analyst. The purpose of a systems analyst is to analyse computers and systems in use of the client,
    determining the best software and hardware to use for the client's needs. This also includes maintenance so everything is up to date,
    working as expected and looking for anything that could be improved upon to improve efficiency of the client. Many system analysts are also programmers,
    creating any specialised piece of software that they may need.
    His plan for achieving a role like this by learning intermediate python skills, improving design and presentation skills,
    and user orientated development via university courses. For the mathematics aspects (statistical modelling)
    he may need to study outside of university for this using whatever resources that can be found on the internet.
    The remainder of the needed skills planned to be picked up naturally as he progresses through university.
  </p>

  <h3>Kowsar Rahman – Full Stack Developer </h3>

  <p>
    Kowsar wishes to become a full stack developer in the future. A full stack dev is simply someone who develops both the back-end side of software
    (the technical side of things the end user doesn’t see, such as the code or the database) and the front end (most often the stuff the user does see, like the UI/UX with HTML and CSS).
    It’s what a lot of people think of when they hear “programmer”.
    Kowsar is already in his final year of university completing many courses and projects both part of university and on the side for fun,
    meaning he already has many of the skills needed for such a role. His skills could be further refined by further developing more complex projects on the side,
    attending “code-a-thon" type events and taking on advanced programming and interview challenges (with websites such as Coderbyte or Leetcode).

  </p>

  <h3>Mason Graham – Systems Administrator/Cyber Security Specialist </h3>

  <p>

    Mason aims to become a systems administrator, hoping to go on to specialise in cyber security related fields.
    A systems admin is the main person responsible for upkeeping and configuring the computer systems and their network.
    This also includes protecting the data stored on the network (hence the cyber security desire).
    Masons wants to get the skills needed by continuing to attend university and picking relevant courses
    over the course of 3 years but also gain experience by taking internships and gaining further understanding (unspecified).
  </p>

  <h3>Nate Winter – Senior Game Development Tools Developer </h3>

  <p>
    Due to Nates passion for video games, he would seek out to become a software developer in the video game industry,
    developing third party tools that game developers over the world use. An example of these tools could be an audio editing piece of software that
    lets audio engineers and programmers build and implement complex audio systems in a variety of game engines (eg: FMOD).
    He has stated that he would prefer to complete a Bachelor of Computer Science as the required skills needed would naturally come through that.
    He would also pick relevant courses and electives in object orientated programming, looking for an opportunity to learn the Unity engine via online documentation and videos,
    and to look for a more entry level game development job upon graduating.
  </p>

  <h3>Sean Shlemoon – Software Engineer</h3>

  <p>
    Seans ideal job would be something akin to a software engineer at a silicon valley type company (such as Google).
    This is developing their websites or applications that are used by millions of people around the world on a daily basis,
    with Google also utilizing and coming up with some of the most innovative technology out there.
    Sean has stated that he plans to gain the skills needed by continuing to study at university,
    self-studying a wide variety of programming languages via online courses or “bootcamps” (at the moment, Java and JavaScript) and hours of hard work.
  </p>


  <h2>Analysis of Ideal Jobs</h2>

    <p>
      After reading over and analysing the all the team members, the following can be concluded:<br><br>
      <ul>
        <li>•	All the team members ideal jobs involve something to do with software development or programming to some degree.
          The extent of this programming ability differs though. For example: a penetration tester would require intermediate knowledge of scripting languages and
          some traditional languages like Python and mySQL while a software engineer would need years of programming experience of advanced languages such as C++, Java or Python.
          Granted these requirements would depend heavily on the specific job listing</li>

          <br>
          <li>•	Some or many of these roles would require web development experience also in languages like Java, JavaScript and PHP (and scripting languages like HTML, CSS and mySQL)
            such as for a full stack developer or for someone specializing in a more cyber security orientated role.</li>

                      <br>
          <li>•	Three of these ideal jobs are more software development orientated jobs (Full stack, game developer, software engineer),
            as in these focus much more on creating software for end users to use, while the remaining (penetration tester, systems analyst, systems admin) are more orientated towards creating,
             maintaining and securing systems and networks in use by workplaces and such. </li>

                       <br>
          <li>•	The systems analyst/systems admin/penetration tester are roles that would work well together as they all have some sort of focus on software and network security, making them similar to each other.
            While full-stack/game developer/software engineer would go well together since they all focus on making end software for regular users to use.</li>

                      <br>
          <li>•	As part of our plans to gain the skills required, they all include using university studies as the primary way of obtaining them,
            with the second most common plan to self-study using online resources such as short courses, videos and text-books.
            Taking possible internships was also mentioned a few times</li>
      </ul>
</p>
<p>

      This knowledge could be applied to how we go on about future tasks, mainly the project itself.
      If we are to develop an app or website, then that task would for the most part be handed off to the members who are interested in heavily software development orientated jobs.
      Meanwhile the more logistical and any security or network side of things could be handed off to the remainder. It is best to hand off tasks that relate to people’s ideal jobs and interests,
      as that would mean they would enjoy doing it thus having more motivation to get a high standard of work done and sooner.
      Overall the group does have a lot in common when it comes to ideal jobs with similar interests and careers.
      They should be able to comfortably understand most potential concepts and terminology that are likely to be brought up.
      The group should be able to get along and work together well.

    When it comes to seeing how well the GitHub commit history represents group contributions, this is not a good way of gauging that.
    The reason for this being that all the group work was done in a .docx file in Microsoft Teams,
    where after finishing everything the person who was tasked with the tools section would copy and paste it into the website –
    handling the website by themselves. It was done like this as we believed this would have been the simplest and most streamlined way of doing the website and overall assignment. <br><br>

  <h2>
    IT Technologies
  </h2>
  <p>
    The information technology world is constantly changing and evolving with new technological innovations to make our lives more advanced and convenient than ever.
    Because of this it is important for anyone who works in an IT related field to keep up to date and be familiar with these emerging technologies.
    The following are four emerging technologies that have the potential to radically change our lives:
  </p>

  <h3>Technology 1: Clouds, Services and Servers </h3>
    <h3>What does it do?</h3>

    <p>
  Cloud technology (or cloud computing) is the technology where various services are hosted and provided by a third party on their hardware/computers/servers in a data center somewhere in the world.
  In other words, you are renting infrastructure, or in other words “infrastructure as a service”.
  The services that can be provided by cloud computing include things such as file hosting, server hosting, virtual machines (operating systems), and networking.
  Some of the most notable cloud services include Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud.
  This technology has been around for several years now but has progressively become more relied upon and utilized by average day-to-day people,
  to large companies and everyone in-between as the hardware and pricing have improved. (Clapp 2022, p.29)<br><br>

  Some of the more specific uses of cloud servers include:<br>
  <ul>
    <li>•	File storing/backups: one of the most popular uses of the cloud is to store and backup any important files in a safe place.
      This means that if you lose your physical medium that these files are stored on, you will be able to redownload them from the cloud service you chose.
      It also gives people the ability to access their data from anywhere in the world as they have access to the internet,
      meaning they will not have to carry around an external hard drive for example. Many people use this for things like family pictures, school material, important documents
      for work or even just their email service.  </li>
    <br>
    <li>•	Virtual machines/computing: a popular use for the cloud in workplace settings is for virtual machines, utilizing more powerful computers.
      The purpose of this ranges from streamlining and cost efficiency of setting up the computers in the workplace (e.g.: all computers are being streamed from a cloud service,
      thus not needing a physical full computer) to performing intensive tasks such as analyzing/processing big data or cryptography.</li>
      <li>
        •	Test environments: extending from virtual machines, cloud provided computers can be used to test a piece of software in a real-world environment without needing to pay for a
        whole new computer with the specific hardware needed. This would cut down development/testing costs enormously.
        The provider would also update the software for you, so there would be no need to remember to update insecure software.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>•	Business agility: Office environments can still purchase and setup physical hardware (including networking and general IT hardware) themselves which is not only costly but takes time to do.
        With cloud computing delivering everything via servers, office/workplace environments can have their systems up and running in a matter of a few hours.
        There would be no need to get specialists into the workplace to set everything up, which can take an exceptionally long time. </li>
  </ul>
